    "#Logging allows modular control—each module or class can have its own logger.\n",

    "#To fix the above issue, Python has a cyclic garbage collector (part of the gc module).\n",

    "#It periodically checks for groups of objects that reference each other but are no longer reachable from the main program.\n",

    "#23.What are the challnges associated with memory mangement in python?\n",
    "#Ans:Challenges Associated with Memory Management in Python\n",
    "#1. Memory Leaks\n",
    "#Python can still suffer from memory leaks when objects are unintentionally kept alive.\n",
    "#Common causes:\n",
    "#Circular references (objects referencing each other, especially with custom __del__ methods).\n",
    "#Global variables holding large objects longer than needed.\n",
    "#Caching / LRU caches that grow too big.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Circular References\n",
    "#Reference counting cannot free objects involved in cycles.\n",
    "#Python’s garbage collector handles them, but it may not always work efficiently, especially with complex objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. High Memory Consumption\n",
    "#Python objects have overhead (type info, reference count, etc.).\n",
    "#Storing large amounts of data in Python objects (like lists, dicts) uses more memory than low-level languages (C, C++).\n",
    "#Example: A Python integer takes 28 bytes, whereas a C integer might only take 4 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. Fragmentation\n",
    "#Python uses pymalloc (memory allocator) for small objects.\n",
    "#Over time, frequent allocations and deallocations can cause memory fragmentation, where memory is available but in small unusable chunks.\n",
    "#This can increase the program’s memory footprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. Garbage Collector Overhead\n",
    "#The garbage collector runs periodically to free cycles.\n",
    "#In large applications, frequent GC runs can slow down performance.\n",
    "#Sometimes developers disable automatic GC in performance-critical code and run it manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "#6. Not Always Immediate Deallocation\n",
    "#Just because you use del obj doesn’t mean memory is instantly released.\n",
    "#If other references exist (including hidden references from modules, closures, or stack frames), memory is kept until they are gone.\n",
    "#Also, Python may hold freed memory for reuse instead of returning it to the OS.\n",
    "\n",
    "#7. Difficulty in Debugging Memory Issues\n",
    "#Memory leaks or excessive consumption in Python can be tricky to track down.\n",
    "#Developers often need special tools (gc module, tracemalloc, objgraph, memory_profiler) to analyze memory usage."
