    "#Meaning: The error for one observation should not depend on another.\n",
    "#Example: In time series data, consecutive observations may be correlated (autocorrelation).\n",

    "# Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors)\n",
    "#Assumption: The residuals have constant variance across all levels of X.\n",
    "#Meaning: The spread of errors should be roughly the same for small and large X values.\n",
    "#How to Check: Plot residuals vs predicted values — the spread should be uniform (no funnel shape).\n",

    "# Normality of Errors\n",
