    "# Qno.1 What is Anomaly Detection? Explain its types with examples\n",
    "#Ans:Anomaly Detection is a data analysis technique used to identify data points, events, or patterns that deviate significantly from normal behavior. These unusual patterns—called anomalies or outliers—often indicate critical events such as fraud, system failure,\n",
    "#security breaches, or medical abnormalities.\n",
    "#ypes of Anomaly Detection (with Examples)\n",
    "#1. Point Anomalies\n",
    "#A single data point is anomalous compared to the rest of the data.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "#In a bank transaction system, a customer usually withdraws ₹2,000–₹5,000, but suddenly withdraws ₹2,00,000.\n",
    "#A patient’s normal heart rate is 70–80 bpm, but one reading shows 180 bpm.\n",
    "#2. Contextual Anomalies (Conditional Anomalies)\n",
    "#A data point is anomalous only in a specific context, such as time, location, or season.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "#30°C temperature is normal in summer but anomalous in winter.\n",
    "#High electricity usage at 2 PM is normal for factories but abnormal at 2 AM.\n",
    "#3. Collective Anomalies\n",
    "#A group of data points together is anomalous, even if individual points appear normal.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "#A sequence of small network packets may indicate a DDoS attack.\n",
    "#Multiple failed login attempts in a short time window."
